    <div id="about">

      <p>This is an archive of Grand Sumo Highlights videos captured
        from the Japan Sumo Association (日本相撲協会 Nihon Sumō
        Kyōkai)
        <a href="http://www.sumo.or.jp/">official website</a> shortly
        after each tournament. We capture these highlights because
        there is currently no other archive <i>of official
        highlights</i> available.</p>

      <p>
        The sumo association publishes
        fifteen <a href="http://www.sumo.or.jp/EnHonbashoTopicsKoTorikumi15/wrap/">highlights</a>
        after each tournament covering bouts from a range of days. So,
        there may not be a highlight for every day, but there will be
        fifteen highlights. In the last few years, there has been no
        commentary with the highlights in Japanese or English. Each
        highlight lasts about fifteen seconds on average. The quality
        is better than typical YouTube captures, and gives one a sense
        of what the sumo association considers interesting.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each <b>highlight</b> page
        (<a href="https://archive.org/download/honbasho-201701-hatsu/highlights.html">for
        example</a>) contains fifteen highlights and each highlight
        displays the day of the tournament, the
        wrestlers <i>(<a href="">rikishi</a>)</i>, and the winning
        technique
        <i>(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimarite">kimarite</a>)</i>
        for each highlight. The winner of the bout is marked by an
        asterisk* and the winning technique is in (parentheses).
        The <b>archive</b> links to the highlight videos stored on
        the <a href="https://archive.org/details/honbasho">Internet
        Archive</a> which has a mandate to keep them available and
        free to all, forever. The <b>results</b> links to the
        excellent <a href="http://sumodb.sumogames.de/">Sumo
        Reference</a> data for each basho.
      </p>

      <p>There are six official, professional sumo tournaments
        <i>(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honbasho">honbasho</a>)</i>
        held each year in Japan featuring wrestlers from anywhere in
        the world. Tournaments are held on odd-numbered months in
        Tokyo (Jan, May, Sep), Osaka (Mar), Nagoya (Jul), and Fukuoka
        (Nov). Each tournament lasts fifteen days (Sunday to
        Sunday). These highlights cover only the top
        <i>(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makuuchi">makuuchi</a>)</i>
        division.</p>

      <p>
        You can watch televised coverage of sumo (with English
          commentary) as it is happening on
        <a href="https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/tv/sumo/">NHK
          World</a>. This is currently the best way to enjoy sumo
          outside of Japan or scheduled NHK coverage where available.
      </p>

      <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumo">Sumo</a> is a
        beautiful and exciting sport with a long history
        and <a href="https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/tv/sumo/sumopedia/">rich
        traditions</a>. It takes only a few minutes a day for a couple
        of weeks, every other month, to keep up with it. I hope this
        archive helps others to enjoy and maintain this tradition.</p>
